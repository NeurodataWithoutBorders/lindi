class LindiReferenceFileSystemStore(ZarrStore):
    """
    A Zarr store that reads data from a reference file system.

    The reference file system is based on the ReferenceFileSystem of fsspec, but
    this is a custom implementation that serves some LINDI-specific needs. In
    particular, it handles reading data from DANDI URLs, even when the file is
    part of an embargoed dataset. This requires some special handling as the
    DANDI API URL must be exchanged for a pre-signed S3 bucket URL by
    authenticating with a DANDI API token. This presigned URL expires after a
    period of time, so this Zarr store handles the renewal of the presigned URL.
    It also does the exchange once the first time and caches the redirected URL
    for a period so that the redirect doesn't need to be done every time a
    segment of a file is read.

    To read from a file in an embargoed DANDI dataset, you will need to set the
    DANDI_API_KEY environment variable to your DANDI API token. Or, if this is a
    Dandiset on the staging server, you will need to set the
    DANDI_STAGING_API_KEY.

    Following the fsspec convention
    (https://fsspec.github.io/kerchunk/spec.html), the reference file system is
    specified as a dictionary with a "refs" key. The value of "refs" is a
    dictionary where the keys are the names of the files and each value is
    either a string, a list, or a dict. If the value is a string, it is assumed
    to be the data of the file, which may be base64 encoded (see below). If the
    value is a list, it is assumed to have three elements: the URL of the file
    (or path of a local file), the byte offset of the data within the file, and
    the byte length of the data. Note that we do not permit the case of a list
    of a single (url) element supported by fsspec, because it is good to be able
    to know the size of the chunks without making a request to the file. If the
    value is a dict, it represents a json file, and the content of the file is
    the json representation of the dict.

    If the value for a file is a string, it may be prefixed with "base64:". If
    it is, the string is assumed to be base64 encoded and is decoded before
    being returned. Otherwise, the string is utf-8 encoded and returned as is.
    Note that a file that actually begins with "base64:" should be represented
    by a base64 encoded string, to avoid ambiguity.

    We also support the use of templates as in fsspec, but do not support the
    full jinja2 templating. There may be an optional "templates" key in the
    dictionary, which is a dictionary of template strings. For example, {
        "templates": {"u1": "https://some/url", "u2": "https://some/other/url"},
        "refs": {
            ... "/some/key/0": [
                "{{u1}}" 0, 100
            ],
            ...
        }
    } In this case, the "{{u1}}" will be replaced with the value of the "u1"
    template string.

    Optionally, the reference file system may contain a "generationMetadata"
    key, which is a dictionary of metadata about the generation of the reference
    file system. This metadata is not used by this class, but could be by other
    software. See LindiH5pyFile.write_lindi_file(...)

    It is okay for rfs to be modified outside of this class, and the changes
    will be reflected immediately in the store.
